# dask-dask-repo-localize-recover

## Status

- Status: `candidate`
- Decision: `promote`
- Candidate decision: `accept`
- Support: `4` `verifier_positive_task_events`; bucket `support_3`
- Reason: candidate passed deterministic verifier-proxy gate
- Official promoted path: `/vePFS-Mindverse/user/intern/jungao/SKILLS_EVO/skills/accepted/v0100/_repos/dask__dask/candidate/dask-dask-repo-localize-recover/SKILL.md`

## Trigger

current task is in repo dask__dask; public trace matches repeated owner paths or adjacent modules; failure signature matches repeated repo failures

## Evidence Gate

Use only when current public evidence independently matches the repo cluster; do not copy a source-task patch.

## Actions

1. Start localization from the repeated owner paths only after current evidence matches them.
2. If the repeated failure signature appears, recover before broadening the edit.

## Validation Hint

derive the narrowest public check from the current issue

## Stop Condition

Stop using this repo candidate if the current traceback, symbol, path, or focused test does not match the cluster evidence.

## Support Summary

5 task events; 4 verifier-positive events; paths=dask/array/core.py, dask/array; tests=none; failures=localization-drift

## Evaluator Summary

candidate passed deterministic verifier-proxy gate
