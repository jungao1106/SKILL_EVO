# dask-dask-repo-localize

## Status

- Status: `candidate`
- Decision: `refresh`
- Candidate decision: `accept`
- Support: `5` `verifier_positive_task_events`; bucket `support_3`
- Reason: accepted duplicate repo candidate already promoted in this version

## Trigger

current task is in repo dask__dask; public trace matches repeated owner paths or adjacent modules

## Evidence Gate

Use only when current public evidence independently matches the repo cluster; do not copy a source-task patch.

## Actions

1. Start localization from the repeated owner paths only after current evidence matches them.

## Validation Hint

derive the narrowest public check from the current issue

## Stop Condition

Stop using this repo candidate if the current traceback, symbol, path, or focused test does not match the cluster evidence.

## Support Summary

5 task events; 5 verifier-positive events; paths=dask/dataframe/core.py, dask/dataframe/tests/test_dataframe.py, dask; tests=none; failures=none

## Evaluator Summary

candidate passed deterministic verifier-proxy gate
